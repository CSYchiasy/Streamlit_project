    **#SteadyDayEveryday** with Jagabot who is your intelligent environmental assistant, designed to simplify daily planning and enhance safety for individuals in Singapore. 
    We tackle the challenge of fragmented information—where users currently have to check multiple sources like the NEA app and various government websites for crucial details 
    on weather, air quality, UV index, and dengue hotspots. 
    Our solution consolidates this data by tapping into **NEA's live APIs** for real-time readings, and historical records for forecast estimates which is then supplemented with a knowledge base of 
    government advisories, tips and guidelines using **Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. 
    This powerful combination ensures you receive a comprehensive, timely, and personalized information, allowing you to proactively plan your activities and make contingency plans with confidence.
