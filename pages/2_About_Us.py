Jagabot is Singapore’s intelligent environmental assistant, here transforming how you plan your everyday. We solve the common challenge of fragmented information: the public must currently navigate multiple sources—from the NEA app to various government advisories—for crucial details on weather, air quality (PSI), UV index, and dengue hotspots.

<h3 style='font-size: 1.8em; margin-top: 20px;'>Our Solution</h3>

Jagabot delivers context-aware advice by:

📊 Consolidating Data: Tapping into NEA's live APIs for real-time, environmental readings from an official source.

📈 Enhancing Forecasts: Supplementing live data with historical records to generate reliable forecast estimates for the coming days.

📍 Focusing on Context: Crucially, Jagabot automatically analyzes your specific date, time, and target region (e.g., Jurong, East Coast) from your query to ensure location-aware and timely advice.

📜 Integrating Guidance: Combining all environmental factors with official government guidelines and safety tips.

This ensures you receive a highly contextual, timely, and personalized environmental report, enabling you to proactively plan your schedule and confidently make contingency plans!
